The game is played with two players on a grid of 3x3.

Each player is either X or O.
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares, and the first one to get 3 of his marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner.

When all 9 squares are full, the game ends in a tie.
